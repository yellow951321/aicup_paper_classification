            ". [Music]. wait what are you doing here. just go by rising 5:30 600 and be done. with it. geez come on it's the holidays all right. I'll make yourselves comfortable guys. because there's a lot for us to cover. here like this awkward segue to our. sponsor team group what do you need for. Christmas and our GB SSD the T force. Delta max SSD features a large mirror. like surface full of RGB goodness click. the link below and it'll also include. their Christmas PC giveaway. [Music]. if you want a cheap CPU that's fast. enough for your grandparents to use. Facebook and email or maybe for a cheap. mass or testbench system there's really. no better choice than the Athlon 3000 G. from AMD at just 50 US dollars it's. closer in price to a bag of potato chips. than to a rise in five and it performs. better than last year's Athlon 200 GE. with a more capable Vega based. integrated GPU compared to Intel's. budget Pentium gold offerings better yet. it draws so little power that you can. pair it with practically any third gen. compatible socket a.m. for motherboard. keeping the cost as low as under two. hundred and fifty dollars for an entire. system built around one of these chips. it is worth noting that for an extra $30. though the rise in 320 200 G might have. the same number of threads but it's. actually gotten double the cores on both. the CPU and GPU so for an entry-level. esports rig that's definitely the way to. go as we move up to the hundred dollar. range team blues quad core Core i3 90. 100 F looks like a good choice for. gamers since it's faster per thread than. the first gens n processors that it's up. against if you're looking for something. more workstation oriented the Rison 5. 2600 is just 120 dollars right now and. Nets you an extra eight threads with. decent per thread performance so take. your pick. depending on what you're looking for. either of those CPUs are gonna serve you. well just like my water bottle serves me. well ltte store calm now let's say you. want something more serious but you're. not prepared to drop the kind of cash. that are really high-end CPU commands. what do you get well here's where things. get hazy of the current gen CPUs the six. core six thread core i5 9400 F is $50. cheaper than the Rison v 3600 with. similar gaming performance but going. with verizon net to extra threads faster. PCI Express Gen 4 and a better memory. controller so as boring as it is to just. keep recommending 3,600 it is just such. a. good value that we want to say look just. bend the extra even in this price tear. because it'll be worth it in the long. run however if you're not a gamer you. can actually still find the last gen. rise in seven 2700 for roughly the same. price as that core i5 and you can expect. a reasonably close gaming experience but. with far better system performance in. multi-threaded applications thanks to. the 2700 eight cores and 16 threads so. in this nebulous 150 to 200 dollar price. range the best CPU for your money. basically boils down to your priorities. once you get into the very high-end. gaming or lightish workstation segment. you've got some outstanding options in. the Rison 730 700 X or at the core i7. 9700 KF again depending on your. priorities there are two major choices. as with the previous segments the core. i7 isn't head and shoulders above the. Rison 7 for gaming and with an eye to. system performance and multi-threaded. performance Rises higher instructions. per clock more aggressive turbo boost. and symmetric multi-threading capability. are all points in its favor here so in. our opinion at least it's less about. Intel versus AMD and more about whether. you should spend the extra 40 dollars. for the better bin 3800 X or a bit of. overclocking or stick with the 3700 X if. you're gunning for best - the best we're. just about there at least for gaming and. consumer grade workstations and it's. here that the real red vs. blue battle. happens the core i9 9900 KF + KS. surround the Rison 9 3900 X in terms of. price and in terms of gaming performance. both are superior however there's a. couple of variables left out of the. equation here while the Wraith cooler. included with Verizon 9 3900 X might not. be ideal it is included in the box and. it's good enough for stock performance. the same cannot be said of those Intel. chips and once you factor in the cost of. a decent third-party cooler and for the. KS by the way you will need it you're. spending an extra 10% or more on top of. the sticker price. now you can maybe justify that. for the 9900 KF if you are a hardcore. gamer but frankly the 9900 keep spending. is only worth it if you must have the. fastest single-threaded performance on. the market which is becoming harder and. harder to imagine a use case for I mean. even a hardcore gamer might throw. together a sick montage once in a while. and the 3900 X is for extra course pull. a lot of productivity weight while not. legging too far behind in gaming for. this segment then we'll call it an even. split between the 9900 KF for a truly. hardcore gamer and the 3900 X if you do. just about anything else. speaking of content creation then. there's really no competition in the. mid-range workstation space 1st and 2nd. gen thread ripper are dead end platforms. that to me honestly make no sense by the. time you're spending this much and. Intel's offerings can't compete with the. consumer 3950 X even though they are. priced significantly higher in most. cases not to mention that those two are. on a dead-end platform that is not. getting any more upgrades by a 3950 X if. you can find one in stock bring us to. high-end workstations so you had. anything to say here as we showed in our. reviews third gen thread ripper. completely dominates this landscape and. intel hasn't got much of a response for. it outside of they're much more. expensive xeon lineup we recommend the. thread ripper 3960 x which brings most. of the tier x 40 platforms current. potential to bear while costing a cool. $600 less than the 32 core but you can. then spend on a good motherboard some. ram or a couple of PCI Express devices. to use up all of those lanes that you've. got at your disposal this was a fun. video for us because it has been a long. time since the cpu market has had such. an exciting year it all started with the. late 2018 release of the core I nine. ninety nine hundred K which actually. held strong at the top of the gaming. charts for a long while but had its lead. constantly eroded by AMD s continued to. GC updates. and window scheduler improvements not to. mention its own security flaws that. needed patching degrading its. performance then not content with this. slow erosion alone. AMD decided to spice things up with the. rise in 3000 series which officially put. Intel on notice. bringing gaming performance closer than. it's been in over a decade at prices. that were even lower than team blue. not to mention bringing PCI Express Gen. 4 to the desktop for the first time. that's not to say that AMD's new x5 70. platform has had no teething issues but. overall I would say it was far smoother. than any previous rise and launch and it. spooked Intel so much that they. responded with their pre overclocked. Cora 999 hundred KS in order to. convincingly hold on to their gaming. performance crown how times have changed. right then Intel all but lost the HD T. market not only the third gen thread. Ripper but to rise into with their shiny. new thousand-dollar Core I 9 10 9 8 exe. trading blows with the 16 core 39 50 X. which costs 250 dollars less not to. mention the cheaper motherboard and then. of course let's not forget the Athlon. 3000 G this is a fully unlocked apu that. AMD snuck in at $50 to kneecap Intel's. low-end to so put simply the back half. of this year was not a good time to be. on Team Blue. so all in all 2017 was the year that AMD. came back into the conversation but 2019. was the year that AMD came back just. overall I just hope that they don't get. too far out ahead and end up like Intel. did because guys don't kid yourself. they've done it for now though we get to. reap the benefits of renewed competition. and you guys get to build some awesome. new PCs for the holidays just make sure. you're subscribed for the rest of our. holiday buyers guides and if you're. looking for something else to watch why. not get your feet wet with one of our. recent AMD build guides that way when. your parts arrive you'll know what to do. see you guys in the next one the mass. drop x - an he4 xx planar magnetic. headphones are freaking sick.

        "contain = \"Dozens were injured in clashes between protesters and security forces in central Beirut on Saturday, one of the most violent nights since anti-government demonstrations started in October. Security forces used teargas, water cannon and rubber bullets to push protesters, who pelted them with rocks and firecrackers, away from the main sit-in site and government buildings in the capital city.The Lebanese Civil Defense and the Red Cross said they transferred 46 people to hospitals and treated the wounds of dozens others on site during hours of clashes. Many of the protest chants were directed at caretaker Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri who is widely expected to be named head of the next government during parliamentary consultations on Monday. Other chants targeted caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, a major ally of the militant and political group Hezbollah. Bassil announced on Thursday that his party would not participate in the next government.On Friday, Hezbollah's chief Hassan Nasrallah said the group would continue to push for a coalition government, putting them on a collision course with Hariri who insists on forming a Cabinet of technocrats. Social media video showed dozens of protesters, who said they had come from the northern city of Tripoli, joining forces with demonstrators in central Beirut. As security forces cracked down on protesters, some could be seen dragging apparently unconscious protesters on the tarmac. Some protesters broke a police cordon and attempted to enter the city's Parliament Square, shut off to the public since protests began on October 17, according to social media video. Local television showed security forces beating protesters with sticks.  Lebanon's ISF said 23 members of the security forces were sent to the hospital during Saturday's clashes, and several more were treated by paramedics on site. Calm returned to Beirut's central district on Sunday amid beefed up security presence. Protesters erected a new banner accusing Hariri of corruption and mismanagement, and holding him responsible for the country's ballooning debt. Protests in Lebanon have been demonstrating against corruption and government mismanagement perceived to be widespread in the country. Less than two weeks after protests began, Hariri stepped down, deepening the country's political crisis. The country is also buckling under an economic crisis that has sent prices soaring, and led to mass layoffs and salary cuts. Business across the country have closed their doors. Banks imposed informal capital controls last month, leading to a severe liquidity crunch.\""
